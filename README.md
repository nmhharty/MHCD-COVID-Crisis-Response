# MHCD-COVID-Crisis-Response
data wrangling and analysis files for MHCD/WellPower COVID crisis response evaluation
 
I used R Markdown to conduct data wrangling and generate a report of initial analyses for internal use by the Research and Evaluation Team in writing a summary report on a weekly and biweekly basis at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020. 

This project relies upon: 
- R Studio Server
- Qualtrics
- SQL Server Management Studio
